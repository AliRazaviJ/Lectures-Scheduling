# 📅 Lecture Scheduling (Greedy Algorithm in Java)

This repository contains a Java implementation of the **Lecture Scheduling problem**, solved using a **Greedy Algorithm**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given a list of lectures with start times, schedule them in such a way that:

- Lectures are arranged chronologically.
- (Optional extension) You can also maximize the number of **non-overlapping** lectures.

---

## ⚙️ Solution Approach

The core of this solution is a **Greedy Strategy**:

1. **Sort** the lectures by their `start_H` (start hour) and `start_M` (start minute).
2. Print the sorted lectures.
3. (Optional enhancement) Extend to classic greedy scheduling by sorting based on **end times** to select the maximum number of non-overlapping lectures.
